* get ppjoybus64,pportjoy64 into a vcproj if possible, else figure out how to build using cmake or even just as-is (ddk?)
* figure out what's wrong with pportjoy64 (error 50)

* ppjoykey and the like need uuid from win7 ddk... why?? should all projs link against lib/win7/ ?
* use .vsprops to share configs between projects
* apply changes to other configs (x64, release builds)
* CMake? gen sln from it

fixes:
* "global namespace" -> c/c++ define "WINVER=0x0501"
* "FileOpenDialog link error" -> link to lib/win7/uuid.lib
* cant find PPxxx.lib -> linker dirs change ..\PPproj\Release to ..\Release
